# 🍽️ Restaurant-Review-Analysis

---

I’m excited to share my complete Restaurant Review Analysis project, completed as part of my Data Analyst Internship at Cognifyz Technologies. This project was conducted in two phases—Level 1 (Data Preparation & Basic Analysis) and Level 2 (Deep-Dive Analysis & Visualization)—to apply real-world skills in data cleaning, analysis, and insight generation.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
• Excel – Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
• Python (Pandas) – Data Analysis & Aggregations
• Matplotlib – Data Visualization

---


## 📌 Project Overview
◆ Level 1: Foundation & Cleaning
• In this stage, I focused on preparing raw restaurant data for analysis:
• Cleaned inconsistent text formats and removed special characters using Excel functions.
• Filtered and removed duplicates, null values, and formatting issues.
• Structured the data for better readability and analysis in later stages.

---

## ◆ Level 2: In-Depth Analysis & Visualization
• This phase involved deeper exploration and insight generation using Python:
• Identified top cuisines and cities by restaurant count and rating.
• Analyzed customer behavior around online delivery and pricing segments.
• Used Pandas for slicing, grouping, filtering, and combining data.
• Created custom plots using Matplotlib for storytelling with data.

---

### 📊 Key Insights Derived
• Cities with the highest number of multi-cuisine restaurants.
• Rating distribution based on online delivery options.
• Most common cuisine combinations in top-performing areas.
• Price vs. rating patterns and delivery behavior trends.

---

### 🎯 What I Learned
• How to apply Excel for structured data cleaning in real scenarios.
• Hands-on experience with Pandas for real-time business problem solving.
• Building clear and insightful charts using Matplotlib.
• The importance of organizing data workflows for better collaboration and communication.
